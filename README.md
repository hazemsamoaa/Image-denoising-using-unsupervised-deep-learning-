# Image-denoising-using-unsupervised-deep-learning-
In this project, we use autoencoder which is one of the unsupervised deep learning algorithms. The idea of Autoencoder is that it contains 2 Neural networks as opposed to each other. one for encoding and the other one for upsampling or decoding. in between there is a code or bottleneck layer. In our example, we will try to use mnist fashion data from TensorFlow, add noise to the images by creating filters or kernels and add them to each image array to obtain the noised image. Then feed those noised images into the autoencoder model to denoise the images. 
The structure of the model is about 4 layers of (convolutional layer 2D with max-pooling). Then one code layer with convolutional layer 2D and then reversed CNN by using UpSampling2D instead of max pooling and Conv2DTranspose rather than CONV2D layer. The input dimension will be the same as the output.
